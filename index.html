        <h1>How am I here</h1>

        <p>Back in 2019-2020's me and my best friend were making games with ROBLOX. That was really fun.</p>
        <p>Later on, somewhere in late 202 my best friend started to write Discord bots with Python</p>
        <p>That was really cool, I wanted to do something same, so I started to make bots with Discord Bot Maker</p>
        <p>With time, I got bored of clicking buttons, I started learning Python really slowly back in early 2021's</p>
        <p>I've been making a slight progress, I could easily write Discord bots in middle of 2021.</p>
        <p>I noticed an amazing "feature" - after a long burnout I slighly increase in skills and willing to learn something new.</p>
        <p>So I quickly learnt HTML & CSS and had atleast an introduction with really lot of languages.</p>
        <p>This includes Lua, Luau, Golang, C++, C, JavaScript, TypeScript, MoonScript, Ruby, and Java.</p>
        <p>I couldn't find any other specialisation to fit me anymore, so now I am slowly getting deeper and deeper into programming.</p>
        <p>At the moment I try to develop Web Applications with Go and TypeScript, I also sometimes help script ROBLOX games</p>
        <p>The largest problem I encounter is getting to develop something big and host it. Due to all the sanctions the gates of AWS, MongoDB, and even Heroku are closed to me. But I ignore all these facts and just keep improving</p>
