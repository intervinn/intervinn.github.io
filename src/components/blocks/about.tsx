            <p>
                I am high school student from Russia
                and a self-taught programmer, interested in building scalable systems, compilers, tooling and games.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
                Before starting to code, I attended art school with a focus on realism. In the third year, my friend convinced me to try to learning Python. Now I am coding since 12. 
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
                Over the years I spent most of time working on small and forgetful projects. I tried a lot of programming languages and technologies before stepping on a solid ground and learning more advanced topics.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
                I primarily work in Go, C#, Luau and TypeScript, but I can also work with C, C++, Java, Kotlin and Rust.
                Despite my artist background, I'm not a fan of frontend development.
